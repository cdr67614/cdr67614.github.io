	<h2> Jet </h2>
	<p>The black cat&#39s name is Jet, and he is a black domestic cat. As you can tell, he is rather fat, but he did not always used to be this large. We first bought Jet when he was just a couple months old! He had one brother and two sisters keeping him company at PetSmart before we got him. It was a tough task only adopting one of the cats and leaving the other siblings behind, but I could only pick one. We knew Jet was the one because he had such a social personality, and he wouldn not leave me alone. Unlike most cats, Jet is never afraid to come rub up against your leg and meow your head off! I adopted him in June of 2009, which makes him about nine years old. Over the years, Jet has gained a few pounds and the tendency to sleep more often, but I will never regret the decision I made to welcome Jet as a member of my family.<br><br>

	<h2> Tommy </h2>
	<p>The leopard-like cat&#39s name is Thomas O&#39Malley or Tommy for short. He is my sister&#39s cat, and she named him after the &#34Aristocats.&#34 He is one and a half years old, and he is a Bengal cat! Tommy is very curious, and he never seems to shy away from the opportunity to play with one of his many toys. My sister keeps Tommy in shape with her special diet plan that she created for him, and his unique coat of fur always makes him the guests&#39 favorite cat to pet. Tommy is very kind because he gets along well with other pets and avoids the will to bite ungentle guests. Tommy has quite the personality and is never afraid to make his presence known on the poker table!<br><br>
